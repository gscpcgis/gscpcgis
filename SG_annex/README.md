Both maps seem to include reference to 1993-08, but the focus seems to be on the annexation from earlier in the year

The map and document from the PVA seem to go together. The map was printed off in 2013 and highlighted by someone, but I suppose is better clue as to what Stamping Ground annexed in the early 1993 annexation.

This was included in the annexation file although all these parcels look to be outside Stamping Ground. The border is coincident with the western border of Tract 5.

Earlier maps seem to indicate most of this area was annexed in 1987, but I don't see a reference to any ordinance
